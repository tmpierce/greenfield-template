# Planning Phase Prompt

Based on the specification in spec.md, please help me create the following:

1. A task breakdown (todo.md) that outlines all implementation steps required to complete this project. Each task should be:
   - Specific and actionable
   - Small enough to complete in a single coding session
   - Listed in a logical sequence of implementation
   - Include checkboxes for tracking progress

2. A prompt plan (prompt_plan.md) with LLM-optimized prompts for each major implementation phase, including:
   - Architecture design
   - Core functionality implementation
   - UI/UX implementation
   - Testing and validation
   - Documentation

For the prompt plan, craft detailed prompts that will help guide an LLM through implementation, taking into account the context limitations and providing appropriate instructions for code organization and quality.
