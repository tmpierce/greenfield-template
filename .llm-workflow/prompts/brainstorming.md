# Brainstorming Phase Prompt

Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let's do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Here's the idea: [PROJECT_IDEA]

Once we've completed the brainstorming:
"Now that we've wrapped up the brainstorming process, can you compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification?"
